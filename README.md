The goal of this project is to develop a Java-based desktop pet adoption center application, using key Object-Oriented Programming concepts and design principles. The system supports adoption management for common and exotic animals using a clean MVC architecture, Swing GUI, and Maven for project structure and dependency management.

**Key Concepts**  
Generics
Adapter Design Pattern
SOLID principles
Comparable and Comparator
MVC Architecture
Swing GUI 
JSON Parsing with GSON 
Maveb 

**Summary: The user is able to:**
Load standard and exotic pets from JSON (pets.json, exoticpets.json)
Add, view, adopt, and remove pets
see list/table of all adoptable pets
Sort pets by Name, Age, Species and more 
Save pet list to a timestamped JSON file when clicking Save

Running the Code: TThe user should make sure they open the project through Maven and have Java swing installed. To run the code simply type:  	
  git clone https://github.com/ebrandwein21/AdoptMe_CS3330.git	
ensure that eclipse has found the src folder (which should be done by default)
Hit the run button on eclipse. There should be the adopt the pet console window popping up on your end :)
